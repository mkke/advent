# advent
This is the design for an advent calendar to be used at work.
It holds 24 250ml bottles of any liquid of your choosing.
Illumination and daily bottle selection is provided by LED strips 
controlled by an Arduino, in turn controllable via bluetooth.
The calendar is meant to be attached to the usual video projector mount.

## Hardware
The plates are laser-cut from 3mm black acrylic.
In the svg, orange means etching, green cutting, and red is the outline cut.
The design dimensions are matched to the maximum area of my Emblazer; I etch with 25% power 1 pass at 5mm/s and cut at 100% power 14passes at 5mm/s.
